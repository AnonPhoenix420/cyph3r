## 🧠 Overview

`CYPH3R` is a modular, Go-based network diagnostics and monitoring utility designed for learning, troubleshooting, and professional network validation. It supports **continuous monitoring**, **downtime tracking**, and multiple protocols while remaining lightweight and Termux-friendly.

Runs cleanly on:

* Parrot OS
* Linux (x86_64 & ARM64)
* Termux (Android / aarch64)

---

## ✨ Features

* TCP connectivity testing
* UDP probing (local echo friendly)
* HTTP / HTTPS status & latency checks
* Continuous monitor mode (tracks downtime)
* GeoIP / DNS resolution (IP or localhost)
* Optional phone number metadata lookup
* Colored terminal output (UP = blue, DOWN = red)
* JSON output mode for scripting & automation
* Version & author metadata flags
* Single static binary build support
* ARM64 / aarch64 compatible

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Go **1.23.0**
* git

### Supported Platforms

* Parrot OS (Linux)
* Linux PCs (Debian-based recommended)
* Termux on Android

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🔹 Parrot OS / Linux

```bash
curl -LO https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.23.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz
```
```
tar -xzf go1.23.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz
```
Verify Go:

```bash
go version
```

---

### 🔹 Termux (Android)

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
```
```
apt install git
```

---

## 📥 Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnonPhoenix420/Cyph3r
```
```
cd cyph3r
```

---

## 🔧 Build & Install

### Local build (recommended for Termux)

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o cyph3r ./cmd/cyph3r
./cyph3r
```

### System-wide install (Linux only)

```bash
sudo install -m 755 cyph3r /usr/local/bin/cyph3r
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic TCP test

```bash
./cyph3r --target localhost --port 80 --proto tcp
```

### Continuous monitoring with downtime tracking

```bash
./cyph3r --target example.com --port 443 --proto https --monitor --interval 5
```

### UDP test

```bash
./cyph3r --target 127.0.0.1 --port 53 --proto udp
```

### HTTP / HTTPS test

```bash
./cyph3r --target example.com --port 443 --proto https
```

### JSON output mode

```bash
./cyph3r --target example.com --proto https --json
```

### Phone metadata lookup (optional)

```bash
./cyph3r --phone +14155552671
```

### Version info

```bash
./cyph3r --version
```

## 🧪 Monitor Mode Explained

When `--monitor` is enabled, CYPH3R:

* Continues running even if the target goes DOWN
* Tracks how long the target remains unavailable
* Reports downtime when the target comes back UP
* Runs indefinitely until interrupted (`Ctrl+C`)
